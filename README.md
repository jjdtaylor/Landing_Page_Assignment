# Personal Portfolio Landing Page

This is my first coding assignment where I have to create a webpage that contains a short introduction, and at least three project cards, with an image and description in each one.

## *Attention*

The nav links in the header and footer can be interacted with, but the links are empty and won't take you anywhere.
